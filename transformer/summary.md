Here’s a comprehensive and structured summary of everything we discussed about Transformers, designed for quick review (30 minutes to 1 hour) before an interview. 🚀

Transformer Architecture - Interview Quick Review

1. Self-Attention Mechanism
	•	Self-attention allows each token to attend to all other tokens in the input sequence.
	•	This enables context-dependent representations, unlike RNNs, which rely on sequential updates.
	•	Mathematical formula:
        \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
	•	Q, K, V come from the same input sequence.
	•	Scaling by \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}} prevents large values from destabilizing softmax.

🔹 Why is Self-Attention Better Than RNNs?

✅ No sequential dependencies → Fully parallelizable.
✅ Long-range dependencies captured in one step → No vanishing gradients like RNNs.
✅ Attention weights dynamically focus on important tokens.

2. Multi-Head Attention
	•	Instead of a single attention mechanism, multiple smaller heads learn different aspects of token relationships.
	•	Each head gets a portion of the embedding (e.g., if d_{\text{model}} = 512 and 8 heads, each head has d_k = 64).
	•	Final output: Concatenate all heads and apply a linear transformation.
	•	Benefit: Enables the model to learn multiple representation types (e.g., syntax, semantics).

⸻

3. Positional Encoding
	•	Transformers do not have recurrence, so we need a way to encode token order.
	•	Uses sinusoidal encoding:
PE(pos, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right), \quad
PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right)
	•	Why sinusoidal? It allows the model to extrapolate to longer sequences.

⸻

4. Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
	•	Each Transformer block has an FFN applied independently per token:
FFN(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2
	•	Expands hidden size (e.g., 512 → 2048 → 512) to introduce non-linearity.
	•	Why is it needed? Self-attention is linear, but FFNs allow the model to capture more complex token relationships.

⸻

5. Residual Connections & Layer Normalization
	•	Residual connections help preserve gradients and improve deep learning stability:
\text{Output} = \text{LayerNorm}(\text{Layer}(x) + x)
	•	Layer Normalization normalizes across the feature dimension:
\text{LN}(x) = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma + \epsilon} \gamma + \beta
	•	Unlike BatchNorm, LayerNorm is independent of batch size, making it ideal for NLP.

6. Transformer’s Computational Complexity
	•	Self-attention complexity: O(n^2 d)
	•	Every token attends to every other token, leading to quadratic scaling with sequence length n.
	•	Feed-Forward complexity: O(n d^2)
	•	Why is O(n^2 d) a problem?
	•	Long sequences (e.g., documents, videos) are expensive.
	•	Researchers have developed efficient attention alternatives:
	•	Longformer, BigBird → Sparse Attention O(n \log n)
	•	Linformer, Performer → Linear Attention O(n)

7. Encoder vs. Decoder in Transformers

Feature	Encoder	Decoder
Purpose	Encodes input into a latent representation	Decodes the latent representation into output tokens
Self-Attention?	✅ Yes, full self-attention (sees all tokens)	✅ Yes, but masked (can’t see future tokens)
Cross-Attention?	❌ No	✅ Yes, attends to the encoder output



⸻

8. Dropout in Transformers
	•	Used to prevent overfitting. Applied at:
✅ Self-attention weights (before softmax)
✅ FFN outputs
✅ Sometimes embeddings & positional encodings
	•	Not used during inference.

⸻

9. How Transformers Handle Long-Range Dependencies

✅ Self-attention directly connects distant tokens in one step → No vanishing gradients.
✅ RNNs process sequentially (O(n)), while Transformers process in parallel (O(1)).
✅ Global context is captured better, improving tasks like translation and summarization.

10. Transformer Variants

🔹 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
	•	Only uses the Transformer encoder stack.
	•	Bidirectional → Each token attends to both past and future tokens.
	•	Trained with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) → Random tokens are masked, and the model predicts them.
	•	Great for: Text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER).

🔹 GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
	•	Only uses the Transformer decoder stack.
	•	Autoregressive → Generates text left-to-right, predicting one token at a time.
	•	Causal Masking ensures it does not attend to future tokens.
	•	Great for: Text generation, chatbots, language modeling.

🔹 Differences Between BERT and GPT

Feature	BERT	GPT
Architecture	Encoder-only	Decoder-only
Training Objective	Masked Language Modeling (MLM)	Autoregressive (predict next token)
Directionality	Bidirectional	Unidirectional
Use Case	Understanding (classification, QA)	Generation (chatbots, text completion)
